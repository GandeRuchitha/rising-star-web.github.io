headerTitle: "Hardware AI motion detection skating Game"
bodyText1: "Chloe demonstrated her deep strength and innovation in STEM fields by developing a skating training app that incorporates AI technology. In the highly competitive U.S. college application process, the acceptance rates of UC Berkeley and UCLA are 11% and 9%, respectively, so it is not easy to successfully gain dual acceptance."
bodyText2: "The app utilizes a combination of hardware devices and sensors to monitor skating data on the app in real time, and collects and analyzes skating data through AI to provide quantitative training advice to athletes to improve training results. This data-driven project demonstrates her ability in data analysis and application, reflecting her exploration in the intersection of artificial intelligence and sports science."
