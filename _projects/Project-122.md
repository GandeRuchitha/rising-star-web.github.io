headerTitle: "AI ForeignLanguangePro"
bodyText1: "The inspiration for this app came from his in-depth observation of the learning pain points of his peers - memorizing vocabulary and grammar is always boring and hard to stick to, while short videos can make people swipe for hours at a time. He combined AI capabilities to create a language learning system based on real short videos with subtitles and interactive quizzes, realizing the perfect experience of “entertaining and learning at the same time”."
bodyText2: "Gary not only completed the whole process from idea conception to product implementation, but also learned key skills such as product research, AI integration, and user experience optimization through the support of his mentor. The project was systematically packaged as a background enhancement case, and eventually became one of the key highlights of his application to UCB."
