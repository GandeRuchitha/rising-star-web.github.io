headerTitle: "3D Printing Monitoring and Failure Detection"
bodyText1: "Christine’s project focuses on 3D printing monitoring and failure detection. She designed a system that can continuously track the 3D printing process, ensuring that each layer is printed correctly. By using sensors and real-time analysis, the system identifies common issues such as nozzle blockages, filament errors, or structural collapse."
bodyText2: "This project not only strengthens Christine’s technical skills in hardware integration and programming, but also reflects her ability to solve practical problems with innovative thinking. With this system, 3D printing becomes more reliable, efficient, and accessible, providing valuable applications in education, manufacturing, and everyday creative projects."
