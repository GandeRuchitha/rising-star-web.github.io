headerTitle: "Post Swim/Outdoor Heated Clothing"
bodyText1: "As a long-time trained swimmer, Matthew keenly captured the user pain point of the cold after swimming problem and designed a prototype of an efficient, safe, and portable heating pad. This is not an ordinary small production, but a complete engineering project combining circuit principles, material science, and programming control."
bodyText2: "The whole project not only honed his engineering thinking, but also embodied Coding Mind's core philosophy in STEM project-based learning and: Turning interests into groundable technology solutions. Matthew has now used this program as part of his background enhancement to successfully apply to New York University!"
