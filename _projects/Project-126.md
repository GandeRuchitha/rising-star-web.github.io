headerTitle: "Water-Spray Alarm Clock"
bodyText1: "At the core of Anthony’s creativity lies a bold reimagination of the traditional alarm clock. He designed and built an intelligent device that not only performs the usual alarm functions but also integrates a directional water-spray module. When the alarm rings, if the user fails to turn it off within the set time, the system activates a water pump that sprays water directly at the user — achieving “physical wake-up” and solving the problem of oversleeping in a playful yet effective way."
bodyText2: "Anthony’s project showcases his ability to combine Arduino hardware programming, sensor integration, and circuit control. Using an infrared sensor to detect whether the user has left the bed and a relay module to control the pump, he balanced practical functionality with fun and personalized design. Beyond technical execution, this project also reflects his growth in project management, debugging optimization, and user experience design, ultimately offering a novel and efficient solution for daily routine management."
