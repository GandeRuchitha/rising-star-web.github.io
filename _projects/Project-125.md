bodyText1: "While exploring ways to help students connect and share interests more easily, Rebecca designed and developed StarSeek—an easy-to-use social media application that brings together students from the same school or around the world. Users can create teams on any topic they’re passionate about, invite others to join, post announcements, hold meetings, and chat with members. For those who prefer joining rather than creating teams, the app allows users to search for topics of interest, and its recommender system intelligently suggests the most relevant teams."
bodyText2: "Rebecca’s project seamlessly integrates social networking with academic communities, offering students an open, efficient space for collaboration. StarSeek not only helps users expand their networks but also sparks cross-regional and cross-disciplinary cooperation. With personalized recommendations and intuitive team management features, the app empowers students to quickly find like-minded peers, turn ideas into action, and achieve a seamless blend of learning and personal interests."
