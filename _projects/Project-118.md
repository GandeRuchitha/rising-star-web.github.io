bodyText1: "HealthPet is a free and fun fitness companion app that integrates seamlessly with Apple Health data, especially for Apple Watch users. By completing daily exercise goals, you can unlock and customize your virtual pet and collect a variety of fun props and environments to enhance your quality of life. Long took HealthPet from a simple idea to a fully functional app during Coding Mind's background enhancement program."
bodyText2: "Through in-depth communication with mentors and continuous iteration and optimization, HealthPet was successfully launched and received positive feedback from users. This process not only honed Long's project management and technical skills, but also provided a solid foundation for his application to NYU."
