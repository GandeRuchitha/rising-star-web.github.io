headerTitle: "Community Resources Hub"
bodyText1: "Community Resource Hub is a mobile application designed to assist homeless and underprivileged individuals in accessing essential resources. The app consolidates information about education opportunities, job listings, and government support programs, making it easier for users to find help. A built-in chat assistant module allows users to type in their needs (e.g., “I need a job”), and the system instantly provides relevant links and recommendations."
bodyText2: "Sonia's project was developed using a modern web front-end framework to build a mobile-friendly interface, coupled with a cloud-based database for managing and updating resource information. The chat assistant module is powered by an NLP model API, enabling the system to provide tailored links and resources based on user input. The overall architecture is modular and scalable, allowing for future integration with Python-based backend services and more advanced AI algorithms."
