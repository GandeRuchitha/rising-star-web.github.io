## About the Congressional App Challenge

Every year, we challenge students in our districts to create and submit their original apps for a chance to win the Congressional App Challenge (CAC). Each challenge is district-specific. As U.S. Representatives, we publicly recognize our winning teams, and each winning app may be put on display in the U.S. Capitol Building for one year.

### Inspiring Innovation through Coding

The Congressional App Challenge inspires students to code, engages Members of Congress, and reaches every corner of America.

### Fostering Innovation

The Congressional App Challenge fosters innovation among middle and high school students by providing them with the opportunity to develop original mobile or web applications. This encourages creativity and problem-solving skills as students tackle real-world issues through technology. By nurturing innovation at a young age, the competition contributes to the growth of future leaders in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).
