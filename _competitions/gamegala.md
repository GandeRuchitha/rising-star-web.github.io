## About Game Gala

GameGala invites K-12 students to showcase their self-developed digital game projects. Students can enter the competition individually or as part of a team. Don’t just play games – become a game creator and developer!

## Competition Rules

+ Each applicant must be a K-12 student enrolled in an educational institution at the time of qualification. Students participate in divisions based on their grade level: K-3, 4-6, 7-8, and 9-12. For team projects with students from different grades, the division is determined by the highest grade represented.

+ Each student is limited to one entry per year. Teams can have up to three participants and will compete against individual projects in the same categories. The judging panel will have higher expectations for team projects, proportional to the team size. Projects must be created solely by the participants. If a project submitted as an individual entry is found to have been made by more than one student, it will be disqualified.

+ On Competition Day, participants should prepare a computer to join a live Zoom meeting to demo their game project and program code. Judges will ask questions and evaluate each project.

+ Students not accompanied by their own parents must be under the supervision of an authorized adult escort, teacher, or administrator. GameGala is not responsible for the supervision of any participant.

## Award

+ GameGala awards the top five projects within each age division as First Place, Second Place, Third Place, Fourth Place, and Fifth Place. In addition, innovative project award, best teamwork award, distinguished ideas award will also be given in each age group.
