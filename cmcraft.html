                                Coding Minds Craft, or CM Craft, is a new system that we developed to assist students in
                                their programming journey. CM Craft is a great tool that your child can use to practice
                                their programming skills at their own pace and get a boost on their computer science
                                journey. We encourage your child to use this system as much as they would like in their
                                own time to hone their programming skills.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Many students who are completely new to programming can struggle when it comes to
                                understanding the bigger picture, which can lead to them failing to complete their
                                homework and understand material in advanced courses. You can access Coding Minds Craft here:

                                <h2 class="h1 my-3">Why use CM Craft?</h2>

                                <p> Programming classes at Coding Minds are often taught once a week.
                                    Students with a clear passion in programming are able to understand the material and
                                    can do assignments in between classes.
                                    However, we also understand that for many other students this is not the case. Some
                                    students have difficulty retaining information and recalling it again after a week
                                    of exposure to it.
                                    Many students who are completely new to programming can struggle when it comes to
                                    understanding the bigger picture, which can lead to them failing to complete their
                                    homework and understand material in advanced courses.
                                    In such cases, the best way for your child to stay on track is to practice
                                    programming in between classes. CM Craft exists for that purpose.
                                </p>

                                <h2 class="h1 my-3">Features</h2>
                                <p>CM Craft is designed to be as simple as possible for your child to use so that they
                                    can get to programming as soon as possible. Here are a list of features:

                            </h2>
                            <p>
                                CM Craft is able to be used completely without the assistance of an instructor. In
                                addition to regular assignments from instructors, your child is also highly encouraged
                                to practice as much as possible using CM Craft. We recommend completing at least 10 or
                                so questions a day, for about 15 to 30 minutes. Consistency is key.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Also note that your child can do topics in any order. If your child would like to move
                                onto something more challenging, they can do so. CM Craft encourages your child to
                                practice the way they want to.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Should your child get stuck on a question in CM Craft or they have a problem with a
                                question, they can report a problem to their instructor using the orange “Report
                                Problem” button on the testing page. Their instructor will be able to later on log into
                                our system and reply to the student’s report with follow up advice and feedback. Our
                                instructors can also notify us if they find that a question has a formatting error.
