shortDescription : "Learn professional game programming, the path from game player to game developer"
description: "Unity3D Game Development is a core course of the L4 Applied Programming level in the Game Animation track. The main goal is for students to start learning the advanced C# programming language, and to use a professional game engine to develop 2D or 3D animations and games that can be published. This course is a useful way to apply the programming fundamentals and algorithms learned at the L3 level to real-world projects. Students in this class will need to complete a basic Unity3D development feature library, master the C# programming language, and complete a complex game project that they can compete with other programmers."
