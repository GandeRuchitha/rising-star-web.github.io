description: "Introductory Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning is a core course at the L4 level. The main goal is for students to start developing applications for programming topics, solving real-world problems, and to be able to work independently on practical AI algorithms and integrate them into projects. In this class, students will need to work with all common machine learning algorithms and function libraries, and also complete a comprehensive AI and data analysis project that can be submitted for competition, to prepare for the next stage of AI 2 programming."
