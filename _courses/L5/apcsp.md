shortDescription : "The purpose of this course is to help students develop the knowledge and programming skills needed to learn the fundamentals of AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) and pass the AP CS P exam"
description: "A key feature of the AP CSP preparation course is that it does not require a specific programming language, but rather encourages students to program in graphical languages (e.g. Scratch, MIT App Inventor, Snap, etc.). Compared to the original AP CSA, AP CSP emphasizes more on students' understanding and application of practical knowledge. By taking AP CSP, students will master the basic concepts and principles of computer science, while developing problem-solving skills and creative abilities. This course will provide students with the opportunity to open the door to computer science and equip them for a broader future in technology."

  text: "We believe that practical hands-on skills are far more important than theoretical knowledge. Every class is set up to provide students with the ability to solve specific real-world problems through programming. At the same time, we will teach students about STEM entrepreneurship so that they learn how to take an idea and turn it into reality through hard work."
