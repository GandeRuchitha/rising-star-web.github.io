shortDescription : "Learn to develop the world-famous Roblox, publish your own game, and start your own business with programming"
description: "Roblox 2 is the core course of the L2 Script Programming level. The main goal is for students to use Lua to write more simple code programs, to experiment with designing programming algorithms, and to be able to independently invent features and integrate them into projects. In this class, students will be required to complete all the common functional features of the Lua programming language. Students will be able to complete a comprehensive Roblox game project that can be competed in a coding project competition. Students will also be prepared for the next stage of their programming studies at L3."
